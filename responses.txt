Question: ('i ghave to go to the gym and do research', 'I think you meant: “I have to go to the gym and do research.” Got it—here are quick, ready-to-use schedules you can start with. Tell me your preferred start time and the focus of your research, and I’ll tailor it precisely.\n\nOption A — Early start (great to feel energized after the gym)\n- 6:30–7:45 am: Gym\n- 7:45–8:15 am: Shower and light breakfast\n- 8:15–9:45 am: Research block 1 (deep work)\n- 9:45–10:00 am: Break / stretch\n- 10:00–11:30 am: Research block 2\n- 11:30 am–12:15 pm: Lunch\n- 12:15–1:30 pm: Review notes / plan next steps\n\nOption B — Mid-morning start (slower morning, still solid focus)\n- 9:00–10:15 am: Gym\n- 10:15–10:45 am: Shower / breakfast\n- 11:00 am–12:45 pm: Research block 1\n- 12:45–1:30 pm: Lunch\n- 1:30–3:00 pm: Research block 2 or light admin tasks\n\nOption C — Minimal two-task day (shorter and flexible)\n- 60–75 minutes: Gym\n- 15–30 minutes: Quick cooldown / snack\n- 90–120 minutes: Research block\n- 30-minute buffer: Wrap-up or another quick research pass\n\nTips to maximize productivity\n- Use time blocks with a strict start/end to reduce context switching.\n- If your research involves reading, consider a 25/5 or 50/10 Pomodoro pattern to stay fresh.\n- Prepare your research materials the night before (papers, notes, datasets) to avoid setup time in the morning.\n- If you have a hard deadline, add a 30-minute contingency block at the end.\n\nWould you like me to tailor one of these to your actual start time, the exact duration you want for each task, or the specific research focus? If you share your start time and any deadlines or preferences, I’ll lock in a precise schedule.')
Answer: ('we can go with option B as I tend to wake up a little later, I also just found out that I have an interview from 12-1', 'Perfect. Here’s a tailored version of Option B that fits your later wake-up and your 12:00–1:00 interview.\n\nRevised Schedule (Mid-morning start with interview)\n- 9:00–10:15 am: Gym\n- 10:15–10:45 am: Shower and light breakfast\n- 11:00–11:50 am: Research block 1 (focused work)\n- 11:50 am–12:00 pm: Quick prep for interview / mental reset\n- 12:00–1:00 pm: Interview\n- 1:00–1:25 pm: Lunch / cooldown\n- 1:25–2:40 pm: Research block 2 (deep work)\n- 2:40–3:00 pm: Wrap-up / plan next steps\n\nNotes\n- A 10-minute buffer before the interview helps you transition mentally.\n- If your interview runs long or you want a longer recovery, we can add a brief 5–10 minute buffer after 1:25 pm and adjust blocks accordingly.\n- Want to tweak the focus of Research block 1 or 2 (e.g., literature review, data analysis, writing)?\n\nWould you like me to lock this in as your default today, or adjust any durations or start times further? If you share your exact research focus and any deadlines, I can tailor the blocks precisely.')

Question: ('what did i do yesterday?', 'Yesterday was January 3, 2026. I don’t have access to your personal calendar or notes, so I can’t know what you did unless you share it. If you’d like, I can help you reconstruct a recap now.\n\nHere’s a quick starter template you can use. You can fill in the brackets or paste your data:\n\nYesterday, January 3, 2026\n- Morning:\n  - [Time] – [Activity/meeting]\n- Late morning/afternoon:\n  - [Time] – [Activity/meeting]\n- Evening:\n  - [Time] – [Activity/errand/relaxation]\n- Tasks completed:\n  - [Task 1]\n  - [Task 2]\n  - [Task 3]\n- Ongoing/follow-ups:\n  - [Task or project] – next actions\n- Focus time blocks (if any):\n  - [Duration] – [Subject]\n- Notable outcomes or learnings:\n  - [What went well / what to improve]\n  \nIf you want to do this more automatically going forward, tell me what apps you use (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Todoist, etc.), and I can give you a simple workflow to export or paste data each day so I can draft your recap for you. \n\nWould you like to start filling in the template with what you remember from January 3, 2026? If you prefer, you can paste any calendar events or tasks you recall, and I’ll turn them into a clean recap.')
